# MERN Stack Project Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up and run the **MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js)** project on your local system.

---

That's a great setup guide! I can certainly transform this information into a professional and well-structured README.md file suitable for a GitHub repository.

I'll use a clear structure with a catchy title, badges, a concise description, and the setup steps you provided.

üöÄ MERN Stack Project
A robust full-stack web application built with the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack.

Tech Stack	Description

Express.js	A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework.
React.js	A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

Export to Sheets
üíª Project Structure
The project is organized into two main directories: backend for the server and API, and frontend for the client-side React application.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure that the following are installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (v16 or above)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [MongoDB Community Server](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)

---

## üóÑÔ∏è Setting up MongoDB (Localhost)

1. Download and install **MongoDB Community Server**.
2. Start the MongoDB service.
3. Default connection URL:  mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/your-database-name PORT=5000




Install all dependencies
Run the development server
Your frontend will now be running on: ‚ûú Local: http://localhost:5173/

‚ö° Setting up the Backend

Open a new terminal and navigate to the backend directory:

cd backend


Install all dependencies:

npm install


Start the backend server:

npm run dev


You should see logs like this:

[nodemon] starting `node server.js`
[dotenv@17.2.3] injecting env (5) from .env
MongoDB connected
Server running on port 5000
